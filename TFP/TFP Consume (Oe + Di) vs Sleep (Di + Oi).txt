When I personally think of consume, I think about opennness to new information, putting on “the brakes” when it comes to new information, accumulating or gathering new info, channel changing to find or explore new options, preference to keep things open, pausing for more input from the environment before putting out too much output, updating one’s worldview, selection from options to “bind” with.


Yeah, this is a fun one.
You are already covering a huge chunk of Consume with what you wrote. I will add more words, angles, and then do a clean contrast with Sleep at the end.

               * Personalized research

               * “What does this mean for my goals”

               * Sifting external noise to find what is personally relevant

               * Building a private evidence base

               * Collecting ammo for future decisions

               * Using external information to protect your own priorities, “I want to make sure I am not missing something that affects me”

2. How Consume differs clearly from Sleep
Simple version:
                  * Consume: external info in, then personal filter

                  * Sleep: internal info in, then personal refinement

Both are low output animals, but they are low output in very different ways.
A. Source of information
                     * Consume:

                        * Primary source is the outside world.

                        * “What do the videos, books, people, markets, data say.”

                        * You are listening to reality.

                           * Sleep:

                              * Primary source is your own internal story, timeline, and experiences.

                              * “What does my past, my inner model, my narrative say.”

                              * You are listening to yourself.

B. Direction of attention
                                 * Consume (Oe + Di, your Explore out + Bind in)

                                    * Step 1: Explore outward, see more, scan the environment.

                                    * Step 2: Bind inward, choose which pieces to keep and attach to your internal priorities.

                                    * Motion feels like: world → me.

                                       * Sleep (Oi + Di, your Bind in + Explore in)

                                          * Step 1: Bind inward around a stable inner picture or plan.

                                          * Step 2: Explore inside that picture, simulate paths, adjust pacing.

                                          * Motion feels like: me → deeper me.

So both end in Di, but Consume approaches Di through the environment, while Sleep approaches Di through its own internal film.
C. Relationship to time and pacing
You already nailed Sleep as pacing, energy preservation, timeline awareness, etc. So, relative to that:
                                             * Consume

                                                * Pauses output to avoid acting on too little data.

                                                * Wants more samples before committing.

                                                * Think: “I want to see more examples before I start moving.”

                                                * Time focus: enough exposure, enough watching, enough gathering.

                                                   * Sleep

                                                      * Pauses output to avoid disrupting an internal long term plan or inner stability.

                                                      * Wants to rehearse, simulate, and refine the internal script.

                                                      * Think: “I need to mentally walk through this and pace my energy.”

                                                      * Time focus: continuity of self over time, future self, past lessons.

Both pause, but:
                                                         * Consume pauses to keep learning.

                                                         * Sleep pauses to keep coherence and pacing.

D. Feel of the inner world
                                                            * Consume

                                                               * Inner world feels like a library getting fuller: more files, more tabs, more folders.

                                                               * Satisfaction from “I found a key piece of information.”

                                                               * Can slip into input addiction, endless tabs, endless videos.

                                                               * Pain point is fear of missing a crucial piece of info.

                                                                  * Sleep

                                                                     * Inner world feels like a journal or timeline getting clearer.

                                                                     * Satisfaction from “I walked through this mentally and it fits my story and energy budget.”

                                                                     * Can slip into over processing, over replaying, being stuck in their own head.

                                                                     * Pain point is fear of burning out or losing the thread of the story.

E. Relationship to output
Both are lower output than the extrovert animals, but for different reasons.
                                                                        * Consume holds back output to keep listening:

                                                                           * “If I start talking too much, I will stop hearing what the world is saying.”

                                                                           * Resists closing the book too soon.

                                                                              * Sleep holds back output to not waste energy or shatter the internal plan:

                                                                                 * “If I jump out too fast, I will burn out or break the storyline.”

                                                                                 * Resists scattering energy.

So if you want a clean differentiator:
Consume is about giving the environment more chances to inform you.
Sleep is about giving your inner model more chances to stabilize and pace you.

3. In your TFP language
Given your framing:
                                                                                    * Consume: Explore out + Bind in

                                                                                       * Outward scanning of reality to discover options, then selective binding of the useful pieces into your personal structure.

                                                                                          * Sleep: Bind in + Explore in

                                                                                             * Inner binding around a story or structure, then exploring inside that structure across time to manage energy and plan.

You can almost see them as two different “inward” motions that start from different sides:
                                                                                                * Consume: world first, then self.

                                                                                                * Sleep: self first, then deeper self.
